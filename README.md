# BDA project: Parameter fitting for damped harmonic oscillator using Stan

This repo contains the course project done for *CS-E5710 Bayesian Data Analysis* course in Aalto university fall 2022. The idea of the project was to invert system parameters of a damped harmonic oscillator using bayesian workflow and `Stan` probabilistic programming language. The work was conducted by the authors listed in the authors of the repository. The `.rmd` file has all the code while the `.pdf` files have the actual report and the presentation. The `.Rda` files have the fit ocjects, so that the code can be run without running the `Stan` models as they are computationally heavy.
